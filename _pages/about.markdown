# We're getting married!

We're gettimg married **8/1/2021** in **Costa Rica.** If you're reading this you are probably invited and have lots of questions. We have put together this site to help answer questions (but feel free to reach out to either of us if anything isn't covered).

We took a trip to Costa Rica from 12/25/2020 - 1/7/2021 to gather some info and get familiar with the country. You'll find some facts about Costa Rica, some info about traveling during Covid, and some fun things we did on our "recon" trip.

We've booked a venue in Bejuco, Costa Rica. For a few days before we'll be staying at the venue. We have a few places reserved there, so please reach out if you don't have a place to stay yet and we will try to help you find a nearby place. You could stay in Jaco the entire time (more options) but will need to figure out an uber/taxi each time you want to meet the group in Bejuco ($5-$10 uber each way. We'll be in Bejuce 3 days).

We plan to stay in San Jose, Bejuco, and Jaco. Check out the [Schedule Page]({% link _pages/schedule.markdown %})
