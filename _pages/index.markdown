<div class="welcome">

        <h1>Welcome to our wedding!</h1>
        <p>
            If you're reading this you are probably invited and we can't wait to
            celebrate with you in Costa Rica!
        </p>
        <p>
            Traveling internationally (especially during Covid) can leave a lot of
            questions. Hopefully most of them can be answered here.
        </p>
        <p>
            Start with the <a href="/about">About</a> and
            <a href="/schedule">Schedule</a> pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            We don't want anyone joining us to feel unsafe (covid or otherwise).
            We believe we chose a late enough date that traveling should be safe.
            We have some information about
            <a href="/covid">Covid in Costa Rica</a> which you will probably want
            to look into before coming.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have a final <a href="/things-to-know">"things to know"</a> list
            you may want to go over as well.
        </p>
