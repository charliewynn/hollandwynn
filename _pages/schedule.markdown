# What day is the wedding?

Sunday August 1st, 2021

# When should I get to Costa Rica?

We want to make it as easy as possible for people to celebrate with us. Everyone is free to come and go as they please, but if you want to leave things as worry-free as possible we've put together a suggested timeline.

## We're arriving on July 28th.

As of today (1/13/2021) the current price grid on google flights is:

![Schedule Grid](\assets\Wedding\flight-grid-2021-1-13.png)

The $300 flights on Saturday, July 31st will arrive too late for the ceremony.
Which means to see the ceremony <u>you will probably want to arrive on Wednesday, July 28th.</u>

As of today United seems to have the cheapest flights. We recommend you look at [Google Flights](https://www.google.com/travel/flights/search?tfs=CBwQAhojagwIAhIIL20vMGZ2emcSCjIwMjEtMDctMjhyBwgBEgNTSk8aI2oHCAESA1NKTxIKMjAyMS0wOC0wOXIMCAISCC9tLzBmdnpncAGCAQsI____________AUABSAGYAQE&tfu=CoQBQ2lkSFNVWXhhMEpITFMwdExTMHRMUzB0YjNWbWF6RTJRVUZCUVVGR1gxOXplbEZOVms5MFFVRVNCekl5TVRveU16TWFDd2loNFFFUUFob0RWVk5FS2dveU1ESXhMVEEzTFRJNE1nb3lNREl4TFRBNExUQTVPQlpLQkFnQkVBRndvZUVC) and view the date grid.

We will hang out in San Jose Wednesday after our flight and Thursday.
[Things to do in San Jose]({% link _posts/2021-1-13-things-to-do-in-san-jose.md %})

We will take an Uber or taxi from the airport to our airBNB. We will stay in the airBNB in San Jose Wednesday and Thursday night (the 28th and 29th). Our airBNB is near the [La Sabana Park.](https://goo.gl/maps/CBm5DpVbK1six8f66) We can help you book an airBNB nearby, or feel free to find your own or hotel. (If you stay at a hotel they may offer a free shuttle from the airport which will save you $20-$30)

## On Friday July 30th we will take a bus from San Jose to Jaco

The bus takes about 2.5 hours and costs a little under $5. An Uber takes about 2 hours and costs around $70.

I can help you buy the ticket online. **The website is in Spanish. If you allow your browser to translate the page for you THE PAGE WILL NOT WORK.** You can translate the page to figure out how to navigate around. But translating it will break the drop-downs when buying your ticket and you'll get errors.  
[Bus Ticket Website](https://www.transportesjacoruta655.com/) - I don't mind buying your ticket if you want to email me and tell me when you need the bus.

We will take the 11:00am bus. You can't eat on the bus, so have a late breakfast.

The bus leaves from [Terminal 7-10 : San Jose, CR](https://goo.gl/maps/TwM3BPQhHBQPp77R8) and arrives at [Plaza Boulevard : Jaco, CR](https://goo.gl/maps/sLpCY2Zfv9PWZAwT9)

In Jaco we will probably get a late lunch and do some very quick grocery shopping. Charlie is going to rent a car in Jaco. We don't think this will be necessary for anyone else (you are welcome to rent one of course). Then we will get everyone into an Uber/Taxi/Charlie's rental car and drive 25 minutes to the airBNB in [Bejuco, CR](https://goo.gl/maps/cD1b9uLx5rgHzvuz8).

We will eat sometimes in restaurants and sometimes family-style at one of the airBNBs. We will decide a food schedule much later.

Taxi's and Ubers may have some limited availability. If you're having trouble getting to town let us know and we'll figure out something with the rental car.

## We sleep in Bejuco the 30th, 31st, 1st. (Friday, Saturday, Sunday)

The wedding is on the 1st. We will all hang out at the airBNBs after. Everyone will wake up the 2nd in Bejuco. We will pack up and go to Jaco next.

## From this point on we expect people to stay as long as they like or head back home.

We will stay in Jaco for 3-5 days and encourage other people to stay and play at the beach with us. There is some hiking nearby as well. Many local stores offer various wildlife/nature tours also.

The bus from Jaco to San Jose stops at the airport. I can help you book your ticket and you can go straight to the airport to go home. (If you do this ask me about it. I'll tell you what you need to know to make sure you get off at the right spot.)

## Around the 6th we will go back to San Jose

In San Jose we will do some more walking around, shopping, eating. And plan to rent a car to go outdoor rock climbing. Everyone is invited, if you want to try or just watch please feel welcome to join us.

## We leave Costa Rica on Monday, August 9th
