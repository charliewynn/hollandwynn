#Day One
We got to our airBnb around 3:30am!

A great view was waiting for us the next day.

The airports did not feel very covid-safe, but everywhere else in Costa Rica has made us feel completely comfortable.

We walked to a French bistro and ordered "Waffle Romeo and Julieta". We sat outside and got a great picture of Leah by a mural.
