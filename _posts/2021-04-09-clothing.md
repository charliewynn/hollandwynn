# San Jose

Shorts and t-shirts. Light dresses if you want. I would bring a light (rain) jacket and maybe a pair of slacks/jeans in case it gets chilly at night.

# Jaco / Bejuco

It'll be warmer at the beach! We'll spend a lot of time in swimsuits, but have some very light clothes for walking around.

# Wedding

Casual! (church clothes / "dressy beach" if that's a thing)

Charlie isn't going to wear a jacket, so no one should be too worried about being under dressed. Khakis+polo or a sundress will make you fit right in.
