# Bus to/from San Jose to Jaco

There is an inexpensive bus you can take from San Jose to Jaco (we rode it before and plan to use it for the wedding trip).

Via car (uber) it takes about an hour and a half. The bus makes a few stops and will end up taking a about 2:10 if I recall correctly.

**You cannot eat on the bus!** Our tickets are for 11am. So you'll want to eat early or have a snack before we get on if you can't make it until 1:30 or so without eating.

# Buying tickets

**If you let your browser translate the website for the bus tickets it will break the webpage and you won't be able to buy tickets**

<a href="https://www.transportesjacoruta655.com/ventaonline/" target="_blank">Bus Website</a>
(You may need to look out for, and approve a pop-up window from the site)

1. Pick which route you need and click "Continuar" (I have extra tickets for 11am on Friday from San Jose to Jaco. If you still need a ride to Jaco let me know!)

2. The next page is fairly straightforward

   - Double check you picked the route "Ruta"
   - Choose your date
   - Pick the departure time you want
   - Select how many tickets you want to buy ("disponibles" means "available". It's telling you how many tickets are currently available for your route at that date/time)
   - Choose where you would like to get on the bus.
     - For San Jose - Jaco: I recommend the 7-10 station (it's a big safe bus station with newsstands and convenience stores)
     - For Jaco - San Jose: you should pick the "Plaza Boulevard (Nueva terminal Jaco)"
   - Choose "Tiquete Normal"
   - **Agregar para la compra** ("Anterior" means "go back")
     <br><br>

3. **Don't click "Eliminar tiquete** I know the button is green and inviting, but it's going to eliminate your ticket.

   - Enter your name (Nombre)
   - Your Email (Correo)
   - Confirm your Email
   - Acepto the terms and conditions
   - _Leave "Deseo que me lleue el xml..." **unchecked**_
   - **Click Paso 4: Continuar con el pago**
     <br><br>

4. There will be a popup. Click the Orange "Continuar con el pago"

5. This page probably looks familiar even in Spanish. Enter your credit card info.

6. After you finish this step it should take you back to the site. Your tickets with a QR code will be emailed to you. You need the QR code to get on the bus.

# Getting off at the airport

If you take the bus from Jaco back to San Jose you can get off at terminal 7-10 (where we got on).
Or if you're timing your flight just right you can get off at the airport (the airport stop is BEFORE 7-10).

**If you get off at the airport.**
Before you step off the bus. Tell the driver that you have a suitcase ("Tengo una melata") and don't get off until he steps off to open the underneath of the bus for you.
