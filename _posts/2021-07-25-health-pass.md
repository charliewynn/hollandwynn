# Costa Rica requires a "Health Pass" to come in the country

Don't worry, it's free! It's their way of collecting your travel insurance info, and a little info on where you're staying to make sure you have a plan if you get stuck there with Covid.

<a href="https://salud.go.cr/" target="_blank">Health Pass Website</a>

The health pass website is very easy to navigate.

You only need an address for your first stay.
If you're staying in the URBN Escalante building (I think most people are) you can use this address:

200 m sur del Parque Francia, Av 1, Barrio Escalante, San Jos√©, San Jose, 10101, Costa Rica

We had no issues with a fake seat number on our earlier trip. If your airline hasn't assigned you a seat yet I personally would just invent one (I did "7a"). Yyou can edit your health pass later when you get a seat assignment but last time we didn't bother and had no issues.

When choosing the Travel Insurance choose "International".
Enter your dates, and supply the "Visa Letter" you got from Trawick when you bought your insurance.
