# Safe Areas

Like any major city there are parts of San Jose you'll want to avoid. During the daytime it would be smart to stay in the highlighted area in the below map.

Any place that's within a block or two of the highlighted area is probably fine as long as you head straight there. I wouldn't walk aimlessly outside the safe-zone.

**At night I wouldn't go more than a block or two unless you're taking a taxi/uber.**
After you get back from dinner I would stick to tv in your hotel/airBNB.

Before/After checking out of your hotel/airBNB you may have time to kill with your luggage. If you're carrying more than a backpack you should find a restaurant to sit at until you can drop your bag off at your next location.

In the safe area you will want to be cautious of pickpockets and only have your phone out if you're actively taking a picture or looking at a map. We didn't have trouble with either, but general advise for traveling out of country.

With that out of the way here's some fun things to do in San Jose:

# Zoo

[Zoológico y Jardín Botánico Nacional](https://g.page/zoosimonbolivar?share) We had a great time at the zoo and would be happy to go back with you!

# Walking/Shoping

Walking/Shopping on Avenida 1 (right half of the safe zone, between the two 'yellow' streets)

# Museum

[Museo](https://goo.gl/maps/WnBeys1VrrXo7oqT6) We did not have the chance to go to the museum. If you go let us know how it was, we'd like to check it out sometime.

# Indoor Climbing

We went to [Mundo Aventura](https://goo.gl/maps/N6WRgzyKsjjz7tha9) and climbed for about an hour. They didn't seem to have an official price for this but we gave one of the employees $20 for showing us the ropes. It's a small gym, if people want to go it should be in very small groups (2-3 people). So we don't hog the walls from the real members. Their shoe selection was limited (Charlie had to climb in street shoes). So bring your own pair if you have big feet.

There is another indoor gym we would like to try. [Pura Roca](https://goo.gl/maps/QCoALJgFdh976L6k6)

# Outdoor Climbing

There's a [free guide book](https://issuu.com/dustinjj/docs/climbing_costa_rica/1?ff) (sign up for a free account). Which describes several spots we can go. We're planning on renting a car and driving to at least one of these after we're back in San Jose after we leave Jaco.
